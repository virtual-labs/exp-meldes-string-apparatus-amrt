      "question": "The points where the amplitude of the wave is maximum and the strain is least",

        "a": "Nodes",
        "b": "Anti-nodes",
        "c": "Intermediate node",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Nodes are points of no displacement.",
        "b": "Correct — anti-nodes have maximum amplitude and minimal strain.",
        "c": "Not a standard term.",
        "d": "Incorrect — anti-nodes is the correct answer."

      "question": "In transverse wave, the particle displacement is .............. to the direction of wave propagation",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Always perpendicular",
        "b": "Always parallel",
        "c": "Either parallel or perpendicular",
        "d": "Neither parallel nor perpendicular"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct — transverse waves displace particles perpendicular to wave motion.",
        "b": "This describes longitudinal waves.",
        "c": "Incorrect — not applicable to transverse waves.",
        "d": "Incorrect — there is a defined perpendicular relationship."

        "d": "2λ"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct — for a string fixed at both ends, fundamental wavelength = 2 × length.",
        "b": "Incorrect — that would be for the second harmonic.",
        "c": "Incorrect — typical for closed pipe resonance.",
        "d": "Incorrect — higher harmonics involve multiples of λ/2."
